# Phase
Phase is a mod for the Simpsons Hit and Run that allows you to go through cars and walls. It works by utilizing .CON files to change the stats on cars and give them enough mass to pass through walls and enough health to withstand it.

To use this, use https://github.com/thexunknown/Phase/archive/master.zip and drag the containing folder into your "mods" folder.
